            </h2>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Sustainable fashion in the luxury sector isn't just about using eco-friendly materials—it's about reimagining the entire fashion ecosystem. From sourcing and production to packaging and distribution, luxury brands are adopting holistic approaches that minimize environmental impact while maintaining the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              This shift represents more than a trend; it's a fundamental change in how we think about luxury consumption and the true value of premium fashion.

              The textile industry is experiencing unprecedented innovation with the development of bio-based materials. From lab-grown leather alternatives to fabrics made from agricultural waste, these materials offer the luxury feel and durability that premium fashion demands while significantly reducing environmental impact.

              Circular Fashion Economy
            </h2>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The concept of circular fashion is reshaping how luxury brands approach product lifecycle. This model focuses on designing out waste, keeping products in use for longer, and regenerating natural systems. Premium brands are implementing take-back programs, repair services, and resale platforms to extend the life of their products.
            </p>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              This approach aligns perfectly with the luxury ethos of creating lasting value, transforming the traditional "take-make-dispose" model into a regenerative system that benefits both consumers and the environment.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Sustainable luxury fashion extends beyond materials to encompass fair labor practices, transparent supply chains, and community development. Leading brands are investing in long-term partnerships with suppliers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and skill development programs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              This holistic approach to sustainability creates positive impact throughout the fashion ecosystem, from farmers and textile workers to artisans and craftspeople who bring luxury garments to life.

            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Sustainable luxury fashion also requires a shift in consumer behavior. The focus moves from quantity to quality, from impulse purchases to intentional investments. Consumers are increasingly valuing pieces that tell a story, support ethical practices, and offer lasting style and durability.
            </p>
            <p className="text-crevre-charcoal/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              This conscious approach to consumption aligns naturally with luxury values—appreciating craftsmanship, investing in quality, and choosing pieces that will be treasured for years to come.
